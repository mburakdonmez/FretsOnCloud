        This project implements the project frets on fire (fofix) that is built with python, in webgl-three.js. (frets
        on fire: https://github.com/fofix/fofix) <br><br>
        How to play: <br>
        First, select a song from the list below. After selecting the song you will be asked for a track. <br>
        Not all of the tracks are playeble yet, so I recommend you to select one of the "PART GUITAR" or "PART BASS" if
        available, <br>
        if they are not available then unfortunately you need to try each one. When you selected the track if there is a
        level selection then the track is probably playable.<br>
        So finally when you select the level the game starts immediately. <br>
        At the level selecting step I recommend to take the keyboard and use "TAB" for level selection and enter for
        clicking, so that way you will be ready when you have selected the level. <br> <br>
        In game: <br><br>
        Pick up the keyboard as shown in the image <br><br>
        <img src="/fofix_how_to_play.jpg" alt="keyboard holding figure">
        <br>
        and use keys: "F1", "F2", "F3", "F4", "F5" for notes and keys "Enter" and "Right Shift" for pena hits. <br>
        You need to press to the correct note key(s) and while the note is down you need you hit one of the pena keys to
        achieve the "hit"
        <br>
        PS: When the song ends nothing happens, the base just keeps rotating, sooo there is that
        <br><br>
        Last but not least:<br>
        With great combo comes great points
